#FORMS OF STRING CONCATENATION
name = "Sam"

#change name from Sam to Pam
#takes the first character from name to the end of the string
last_letters = name[1:]

#Adds 'P' to "am"
print('P' + last_letters)



# add a variable to a string
x = 'Hello World'
print(x + " It is beautiful outside")

#Print the string, g, in all uppercase letters
g = 'Yoogoo'
print(g.upper())

#Split the string at the character 'g' to return a list of the split string without the designated character that was split from the string
print(g.split('g'))

#Another example
a = "Hi this is a string"
print(a.split('i'))
